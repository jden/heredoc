# heredoc
multiline strings for javascript

## usage

this technique takes advantage of `Function.prototype.toString()`

```js
    var heredoc = require('heredoc')
    var str = heredoc(function () {/*
    within this comment block,
    any text
    will
      be
        treated
          as
      pre-formatted
        multiline text
    (kinda like html <pre>)
    */})
    console.log(str)
```

You can also strip leading indentation:

```js
var text = heredoc.strip(function() {/*
      <body>
        <p>indented strings are fine.</p>
        <p>the preceding spaces will be shrinked.</p>
      </body>
    */})
```

will result in:

```
<body>
  <p>indented strings are fine.</p>
  <p>the preceding spaces will be shrinked.</p>
</body>

```

You can also pass params to heredoc:

```js
var text = heredoc.strip(function() {/*
      My first name is {firstname} and my last name is {lastname}
    */}, {firstname: "Andrew", lastname: "Schools"})
```

will result in:

```
My first name is Andrew and my last name is Schools

```

## kudos

thanks to @izs - I first saw this technique when reading through npm source. I find it to be much neater than lots of manual string concatenation.
